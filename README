This is a really simple accounting program. It was orginally designed for
a small screen.

You have to create the list of your accounts by hand. Just use you favourite
editor using the file accounts as a guide. You can add accounts later but
don't remove them if they have transactions.

If you want subpixel rendering you might have to add the following lines to
your ~/.Xresources

Xft.antialias: 1
Xft.hintstyle: hintmedium
Xft.lcdfilter: lcddefault
Xft.rgba: rgb
